### _"What is this?"_

This is an extremely basic example of what you can do with Github's REST API.

### _"How I can run/build this?"_

This example don't use any external library, so...

If you just want to run it:

```
go run Github.go [flags] <Username1, Username2, ..., UsernameN>
```

If you want to get a binary (build):

```
go build Github.go
# And then:
./Github [flags] <Username1, Username2, ..., UsernameN>
```

If you want to known what are the available flags, just run the with the flag `-help` to see it.
